Quantitative Trading Strategy Optimization with Machine Learning
This project builds a robust multi-asset trading framework that combines technical indicator rule optimization, machine learning-based hyperparameter tuning, and portfolio construction via mean-variance optimization.

Itâ€™s designed to develop and evaluate rule-based strategies for different stocks, generate signals, backtest results, and optimize portfolio allocation.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
âœ… Technical Indicator Optimization

MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more

Evaluates variations via backtesting

âœ… Machine Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning

Uses optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization, grid/random search) to find best indicator parameters

Integrates easily with scikit-learn or custom models

âœ… Custom Signal Generation

Rule-based logic for MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

Easily extendable with RSI, ADX, Stochastic, etc.

âœ… Backtesting Engine

Entry/exit logic, trade evaluation

Bootstrapped Sharpe ratio + equity curve visualization

âœ… Portfolio Optimization

Mean-variance optimization (Sharpe-maximizing weights)

Option to input manual weights
