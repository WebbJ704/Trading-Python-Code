# Quantitative Trading Strategy Optimization with Machine Learning

This project builds a robust **multi-asset trading framework** that combines **technical indicator rule optimization**, **machine learning-based hyperparameter tuning**, and **portfolio construction** via **mean-variance optimization**.

It’s designed to develop and evaluate rule-based strategies for different stocks, generate signals, backtest results, and optimize portfolio allocation.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Technical Indicator Optimization**  
  - MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more  
  - Evaluates variations via backtesting

- ✅ **Machine Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  - Uses optimization techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization, grid/random search) to find best indicator parameters  
  - Integrates easily with `scikit-learn` or custom models

- ✅ **Custom Signal Generation**  
  - Rule-based logic for MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.  
  - Easily extendable with RSI, ADX, Stochastic, etc.

- ✅ **Backtesting Engine**  
  - Entry/exit logic, trade evaluation  
  - Bootstrapped Sharpe ratio + equity curve visualization

- ✅ **Portfolio Optimization**  
  - Mean-variance optimization (Sharpe-maximizing weights)  
  - Option to input manual weights

## 🤖 Machine Learning Component

- **Hyperparameter Optimization** is used to tune strategy parameters (e.g., MACD fast/slow periods) for each stock.
- Techniques used:
  - Random Search / Grid Search
  - Bayesian Optimization (e.g., using `Optuna` or `scikit-optimize`)
- Evaluation is based on maximizing risk-adjusted return (e.g., Sharpe ratio) over bootstrapped samples.
